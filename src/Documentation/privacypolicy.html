<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <dl>
  <dt>If you're playing Mino:Script games hosted on clementsparrow.github.io:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
  Mino:Script games accessed at URLs like "<i>clementsparrow.github.io/PuzzleScript/src/play.html?...</i>" are stored on GitHub as <a href="https://gist.github.com">gists</a> and fetched from there with <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub's Developer API</a>. These games are thus subject to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/">GitHub's privacy policy</a>.
<p>
  Why do I need to store things there?
<p>
  I need to store games somewhere - I think the sharing functionality is really important for Mino:Script, and makes making + sharing games really easy.
<p>
  If you don't want to use the online-sharing facilities you can still save/load game locally, and can still export standalone html files. And GitHub take care of moderation/spam filtering, which otherwise could cause a lot of stress.
  <p>
    If you don't want to use the online-sharing facilities you can still save/load game locally, and can still export standalone html files. I also plan in the future to support other hosting providers than GitHub.

  <dt>If you're creating Mino:Script games:</dt> 
  <dd>
<ul>
  <li>Mino:Script can save things to your browser's localstorage - it is just used for loading/saving files in the file save dropdown.
  <li>If you want to share a game, you will need to authorize Mino:Script to create and modify gists with your <a href="http://github.com">GitHub account</a>.  Then, when you hit the SHARE button, a publicly-accessible copy of your game is uploaded to a <a href="http://github.com">gist</a> in your GitHub account.
  <li>If you want to "save on cloud" a game, you will need to authorize Mino:Script with your <a href="http://github.com">GitHub account</a>.  Then, when you hit the button labeled SAVE ON CLOUD, a private copy of your game is uploaded to a <a href="http://github.com">gist</a> in your account.  It is not publicly anounced and will not appear in search results, but is still available to anybody who knows its URL.
