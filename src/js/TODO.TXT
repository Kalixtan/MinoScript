Feture list:
	General:
		- Make it so a PC (Win/Linux/Mac) exicutible build can be made and the game can tell what its running on to make the UI better for the user.
		- Controller subport? (how posible is this)
		- Compressing things like level graphics for less load times?
		- Graphics optimisations (storeing all sprites as a sheet)
		- splitting project into difrent tabs
		- Check for improvements to mobile
		- Add second action button?
		- remove Caps lock on funtion names (maybe make a compatibilty funtion in prelude?)
		
	MENU:
		- ADD OPTIONS:
			- Rebindable controls
			- video settings (for mobile, PC and webplayer)
			
		- ADD CREDITS (likely just long muliline string setment in the project)
		- Title:
			- Custom title screen graphics
	
	music/sfx:
		- allow some way to import music ( MIDI MP3 ect )
		- allow some way to import sfx ( OOG WAV ect )
	
	Graphics:
		- Allow Base64 incoded PNG/GIF's?
		- offsets useing X/Y not direction/distence
	
	TWEEN system:
		Controls:
			- tween_duration (add tween speed) (this is defult can be overwritten per object)
			- use_tween (Turn on and off tweening) (this is defult can be overwritten per object)
		
		Objects:
			- Add all controls (see above) to indivigal objects
			
		Animation:
			- remove choppyness (likely not truely resetting the value and use the method used on our other released games)
			- Add bounce/overshot (aka make the target slightly further away than the true target point)
			- Add to the offset never set it
			
		(Work out what else we can do to help it feel more fluid to the user)

	VAR System:
		General:
			- Add TRUE/FALSE (this will equals 0/1)
			- Allow negtive ints
			
		Setup:
			- a global tag that will mean that it doesnt reset when levels change (can be used for global score or coins ect)
			- allowing VARS to be set to the value of prevesly set VARS
			
		Bool statements:
			- if only a number is given in a bool set it so it returns true if not 0
			- abilty to set a value to a bool "{ Val1 = {val2 == 0} }" (unsure how i'll impment this in code)
		
		Magic Values:
			- Count-[OBJ] (will count however meny objects of that type exist)
		
		Oprators:
			- Add Modulo funtion
			- Add NOT funtion (to make number negtive)
			- Add // funtion (devision but returns closest integer value)
			- Add * (or x) funtion (muliply)
			
	Levels:
		externaly editable levels
		custom level format
		Levels with layering (scrapping the old style method)
		
		
	Editor:
		offline editor?
